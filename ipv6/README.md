## Introduction

The networks in the Hacking Villa are **IPv6 only**. So if your
computer has IPv6 turned off, you might have trouble connecting to the
Internet. Aside from that, some of your software might behave
differently or you might have questions on how to use specific
applications.

If that is the case, fork th√¨s repository, copy template.md to
your-use-case-or-question.md and create a PR. We will then merge it
and add a reply to it.
